here is how we can create our own package.jon file 

usi npm init and it ask for some details fill them and verify then the file is created 

we never push the node moudules on the github (because it is very large )
we only push package.json and 
reinstall them using the    "npm i"


*** what is nodemon package 
-> it keeps our file in the running state and if any changes happen then it reflected in output no need to restart
